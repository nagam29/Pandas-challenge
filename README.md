# Analysis on School Types and Academic Performance

### Goal
Examine whether the academic performance of students with charter schools is better than that those with district / public schools

### Summary

The majority of the district school students presented the similar academic achievement with the students with the charter schools. For example, the math scores of the students with the district schools were higher than 70, that was the same as the scores with the charter school students. However, the variability of the scores were larger with the district school students. This seemed to be one of the reasons that the average test scores of district school students appear to be lower than the charter school students.  We need to look into the reasons for the large variability in the scores before concluding that the academic performance of district schools is lower than the charter schools.
